                        Former India player RP Singh said that MS Dhoni’s fandom increased during IPL 2023 as fans thought that he was retiring after the season. 

“Last year, the fan-following we witnessed (for Dhoni) was beyond my understanding. Maybe, that’s because it’s been built over the years. MS has performed incredibly for CSK since the beginning and has led them to multiple trophies,” RP Singh told JioCinema. 

“Last year, people thought that it might be his last year as an active player, and it might be their final chance to see him play live. That may have caused a 25 to 30% increase in his fan-following. The moment he wore his pads last year, our viewership increased,” he added. 

Recalling Dhoni’s interest in receiving appreciation from fans, he said, “I remember this team meeting a long time ago in 2006-2007 when we spoke about what drives players to perform. At that time, MS said, ‘When I get off a bus, I feel like two people are looking at me. When will those two turn to four and when will the four turn to 40? My passion for the game is because I want to play for the fans. I want the fans to see that MS Dhoni hits shots like this.”

Former India and Super Kings’ player Suresh Raina stated that after Sachin Tendulkar, it is MS Dhoni who receives tremendous love from the fans.  

“Absolutely, I saw Sachin Tendulkar receive this kind of love when we first came into the Indian team. That love was showered on Mahi bhai by Indian fans thereafter. ‘MSD, Mahendra Singh Dhoni’ the name alone is embedded in people’s hearts,” said Raina. 

Former Super King player Parthiv Patel highlighted a few moments where fans showered their love for the players. 

“There have been three instances of fans showing this kind of love for players. In 2011 when we won the ODI World Cup. Then, when Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, the entire ground waited to hear his farewell speech. And last year whenever MS Dhoni played in Chennai, not a single fan would leave until his interview was over.”

Speaking about BCCI retiring the No.7 and No.10 jerseys, Patel stated that Dhoni is an emotion. 

“Look at the two jerseys retired by the BCCI. One is the No. 7 and the other is the No. 10. It shows that Dhoni isn’t just a player, he's an emotion. The way he connects with people, whenever he meets people anywhere, he'll talk to them as respectfully as possible. Only after doing all of this, you can create the aura that makes everybody love you.”
